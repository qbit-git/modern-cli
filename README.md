# Modern Alternatives of Command-Line Tools

## Rust
### [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) <- grep
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. ripgrep has first class support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for every release. ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

### [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) <- cat
A cat clone with wings.

### [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) <- find
fd is a program to find entries in your filesystem. It is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find. While it does not aim to support all of find's powerful functionality, it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.

### [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) <- ls
exa is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.

### [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs) <- ps
procs is a replacement for ps written in Rust.

### [sd](https://github.com/chmln/sd) <- sed
s[earch] & d[isplace]
sd is an intuitive find & replace CLI.

### [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) <- du
du + rust = dust. Like du but more intuitive.

### [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship)
The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!

### [bandwhich](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich) <- nethogs
This is a CLI utility for displaying current network utilization by process, connection and remote IP/hostname

## Go
### [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.

## Python
### [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
Install and Run Python Applications in Isolated Environments

### [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client)
Python command-line client for [tldr pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

### [glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances) <- top
An eye on your system
Glances is a cross-platform monitoring tool which aims to present a large amount of monitoring information through a curses or Web based interface. The information dynamically adapts depending on the size of the user interface.

### [xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh)
xonsh is a Python-powered, cross-platform, Unix-gazing shell language and command prompt.
The language is a superset of Python 3.6+ with additional shell primitives. xonsh (pronounced conch) is meant for the daily use of experts and novices alike.
